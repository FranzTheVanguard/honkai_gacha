## Gacha Odds
Data is mostly taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/houkai3rd/comments/lxkuq8/soft_pity_after_75_pulls_in_valkyrie_expansion_a/), which is also
referenced in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCBSmtXbZlHR-WLNw1yLKIW1kvd6jVGl9gKkqHoA7V0/edit?usp=drivesdk).  

The short version is the advertised rates for the S-Rank are 1.5%, while rate-up A-rank is 4.5%, and
the normal A-ranks are 3%.  
After the research above, it is concluded the overall chance for S-ranks is about 2% because
of the soft pity system which seems to start after the 75th pull. Since I don't have
the data myself, this is made with some assumptions regarding the exact number of the 
amount of the soft pity gained per pull.
